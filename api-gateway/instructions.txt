Once tested. then deploy and invoke the url from browser to get results back

now for talking to lambda :

create a policy for scan and query access to dynamodb (use same as above )
check get-all-authors-lambda-role for a sample role
The apito lambda permissions are amnaged internally when you integrate the lambda
