Movie example example here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.JavaScript.html

to add cognito db replace the direct access key/pass:

AWS.config.update({
  region: "eu-west-2",
  accessKeyId: "your-key-id",
  secretAccessKey: "your-access-key"
});

with this:

AWS.config = {
    region: "eu-west-2",
    credentials: new AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials({
            IdentityPoolId : 'your-identity-pool-id',
          }),
};


design considerations
==
how many tables do you need? mostly only i
Identify Access patterns. then identify the primary key and indexes to minimise the no of requests to satisfy each access pattern.
mostly one table for company,projects,employees etc
